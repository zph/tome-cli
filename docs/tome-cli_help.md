## tome-cli help

help displays the usage and help text for a script

### Synopsis


	The help command extracts the usage and help text from a script file and displays it to the user.

	Help text is extracted from the script file by searching for the first line that includes "USAGE: ".

	When printing long form help text, the help command will print the help text from the script file
  starting from the line after the "USAGE: " line and ending on the first blank line.

	Example: (more can be found in the examples directory)

	#!/bin/bash
	# USAGE: script.sh [options] <arg1> <arg2>
	# This is the help text for the script
	# It can span multiple lines
	# and will be displayed to the user when they run "tome-cli help script.sh"

	echo 1

	In this example the USAGE line is "USAGE: script.sh [options] <arg1> <arg2>"
	The help text is the lines following the USAGE line until the first blank line.
