  # macOS:

Zsh:

  # If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
  # you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

  $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ tome-cli completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_tome-cli"

  # You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

PowerShell:

  PS> tome-cli completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

  # To load completions for every new session, run:
  PS> tome-cli completion powershell > tome-cli.ps1
  # and source this file from your PowerShell profile.

Using completions from within child scripts

Once completions discover an executable and non-ignored script,
tome-cli will check if the script has TOME_COMPLETION declared in file.
If so, it will attempt fetch completions from the script itself.

This is accomplished by passing --complete to the script and capturing the output.

The output syntax is newline-separated strings where each line is composed of
a completion (e.g. a flag or argument), a tab character, and a description of the completion.



```
tome-cli completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for completion
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -d, --debug               debug logs
  -e, --executable string   executable name
  -r, --root string         root directory containing scripts (default ".")
```
