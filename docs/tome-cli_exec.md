Usage: tome-cli exec <path-to> <script> [args...]

The exec command executes a script file with the provided arguments.

The exec command will search for the script file in the root directory

TOME_ROOT and TOME_EXECUTABLE are injected into the environment as well

If the executable name is 'kit' the additional environment variables would be:
